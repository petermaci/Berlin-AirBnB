# Berlin-AirBnB
Data analysis of AirBnB rental data available for Berlin, Germany. 

# Objective 
AirBnB - Berlin
Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The objective of this study is to analyze what variables may impact the price of housing and search for any noticable patterns.

1. price
